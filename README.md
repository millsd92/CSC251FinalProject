# CSC251FinalProject
This is the final project for Forsyth Technical Community College's CSC-251 Java class. It is a GUI program for a coffee shop that connects to a local database to perform various tasks on that database. The user can add a new customer, add an order to an existing customer, view all customer's data, or view all orders by a specific customer via SQL querying.
## Things to Note
This program used a local database using the JDBC Derby Driver. Due to this, you will **HAVE to have NetBeans 8.X** (I used NetBeans 8.2) with the Derby Driver installed. Newer versions do not use this driver and, therefor, will not work as intended with this program. The local database **NEEDS to be hosted on port 1527** and **BE named dbCoffeeStoreData.** I have included a folder that has the database that I personally used, but there is a button on the main page (as per the requirements for this program) to create the tables in the database once there is a connected, local Derby database on the system with the same name as mentioned previously.
